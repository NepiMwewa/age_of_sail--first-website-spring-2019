				<h2>Ship Roles</h2>
					<p>Every ship in the navy had a special role that it needed to do in order best serve its 
					strengths and weaknesses. Generally new captains were placed on small unrated ships in order 
					to gain experience before they moved up to commanding Frigates and only the top of the top 
					were to captain the massive Ship of the lines (<abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>).</p>
						<h3>Ship of the Line</h3>
							<div class="two_column">
								<h4>Crew sizes</h4>
									<p>The crew sizes varied immensely in <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr> but for the most part they were in the 500s for 
									4<sup>th</sup> rates and over a thousand crew for some of the bigger 1<sup>st</sup> rates. 
									However on everyship there were many outstanding officers that helped to bring order to 
									the ship and command the crew. After all there is no way that only the captain himself 
									could order every crew memeber on such a behemoth that could have over a thousand men doing 
									jobs such as working with the sails, rigging, loading and firing cannons.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="two_column">
								<h4>Line fighting</h4>
									<p>Line fighting were most importance aspect of any large naval battle. The coordination 
									of the <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>s were the largest factor in the success of a battle. The ships would 
									form a single file line in order to have more cannons able to be pointing at the enemy.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="two_column">
								<h4>Prestige</h4>
									<p>The <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr> were made to be the glory of the nation since to build one took 
									many years and massive amount of resources. These ships had extensive craftman ship not only to look amazing 
									but also strong enough to hold together when being shot at.</p>
							</div>
						<h3 class="clear">Frigates</h3>
							<div class="two_column">
								<h4>Merchant Hunting</h4>
									<p>They also filled the role of hunting enemy merchants in order to catch <dfn>prizes</dfn>(a captured 
									ship that was brought back to port to be resold) in order to make money. Crew and captains that 
									took prizes could gain great wealth from capturing ship. Furthermore it took one more ship 
									away from the enemy nation while giving your own nation a ship. So the fast and strong 
									Frigates were quite focused on this.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="two_column">
								<h4>Support for line ships</h4>
									<p>Because of the slow nature of <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>s the frigate filled the role as a support 
									and body guard of the <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>s. However, they were also used for escorting trade 
									ships through dangerous pirate and enemy waters.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="two_column">
								<h4>Crew size</h4>
									<p>Frigates generally had between 200 and 500 crew for some of the larger Frigates like the 
									<em>USS Constitution</em>.</p>
							</div>
						<h3 class="clear">Unrated</h3>
							<div class="two_column">
								<h4>Merchant hunting</h4>
									<p>Just like the Frigates the unrated ships also hunted merchants but didn't go after that 
									big of prey and instead focused on smaller unarmored ships to capture.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="two_column">
								<h4>Crew size</h4>
									<p>Unrated ships generally had less crew than Frigates but some did have more. Like with the Xebec style of 
									ship, it was not uncommon for it to have up to 400 crew in some cases. The Xebec was a popular style of ship used 
									in the Mediterranean. It was used as both a trade ship and warship because of their superb speed characteristics.</p>

					<h3 class="clear">Sail Terms</h3>
						<dl>
							<dt><dfn>Yard</dfn></dt>
								<dd>Refers to a beam of wood connected to the mast of the ship horizontally 
								that the sails hangs down from. These yards could be rotated to beable to better catch the wind.</dd>
							<dt><dfn>Rigging</dfn></dt>
								<dd>Refers to the ropes and other things that moves connects the masts, sails and yards together.</dd>
							<dt><dfn>Trim Sails</dfn></dt>
								<dd>Refers to the act of rotating the yards and sails to catch 
								the wind at the best point possible.</dd>
