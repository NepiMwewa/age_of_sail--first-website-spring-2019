				<h2>Weaponry</h2>
					<p>The weaponry of the ships made it so that it could fight. Without weapons it was practically a merchant ship which would not
					be as cool.</p>
					<h3>Cannon Types</h3>
						<p>There were many different type of cannons but I will go over the most common ones used during this time.</p>
					<div class="three_column">
						<h4>Long cannon</h4>
							<p>The <em><dfn>Long cannon</dfn></em> were the most accurate and had the longest range out of all the cannons. They were called this to 
							differentiate it from the shorter cannons, namely the Carronades. These were typically placed on the lower gundecks of the ship, since they were 
							quite large and heavy with long barrels, hence their name Long cannon. They were also the main cannon that the Americans used on 
							their frigates and were known to beable to out range and have better accuracy when compared to the english and french.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="three_column">
						<h4>Carronade</h4>
							<p>The <em><dfn>Carronade</dfn></em> were short stubby barreled cannons that would fire large cannon balls at the enemy ship. Because of their 
							short barrels the shots were very inaccurate and were very limited in range. These cannons would only be used when the target 
							was close range. But these were deadly since they weighed much less than the long cannons and could be mounted on the <dfn>top deck</dfn>
							of the ship(the upper most deck of the ship).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="three_column">
						<h4>Swivels</h4>
							<p>The <em><dfn>Swivel</dfn></em> was a small caliber gun mounted on the railings of the ship in order to shoot at crew that were on the top deck 
							when either passing closely by or when boarding the enemy ship. Like the name implies they 
							could be swivel left and right like a turret to have better target accuracy.</p>
					</div>
					<h3 class="clear">Shot Types</h3>
						<p>Like different cannons had different uses so did the ammunition that were fired from the cannons. In many cases it varied quite a 
						bit more than the cannons did.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Round shot</li>
							<li>Chain shot</li>
							<li>Bar shot</li>
							<li>Grapeshot</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Each shot type had a special and unique trait and use for naval combat.</p>
						<div class="two_column">
							<h4>Chain and Bar shot</h4>
								<p>Chain and Bar shot were special to the naval cannons in that they were never used in land warfare. The <dfn>chain shot</dfn> were two small 
								metal balls with a chain connecting them so that they have a wider area of damage, hence the name chain shot. Like chain shot, <dfn>bar 
								shot</dfn> were two round metal balls connected by a solid metal bar. The reason for these unique shot type is quite simple. They were 
								used to take out the sails and rigging of ships in order to slow and cripple the ships. Also with the weakened rigging it made it 
								possible for demasting to occur. This was quite the deadly shot for anyship but had very limited range and  the accuracy was quite 
								bad.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="two_column">
							<h4>Round shot</h4>
								<p><dfn>Round shot</dfn> was the standard ammunition type that ships fired. Just like the name, it is the standard solid metal ball that you 
								would see fired in many movies and cartoons from both naval and land cannons. They are great at making large holes in ships at 
								great distances but that is not what you need all the time which we will get to next.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="two_column">
							<h4>Grapeshot</h4>
								<p><dfn>Grapeshot</dfn> is just what it sounds like, it is a cluster of small metal balls that were shot out of a cannon that spread like buckshot 
								from a shotgun. This devastated crew and were the best shot used to take out and cripple the enemies crew. This shot had the 
								shortest range and worst accuracy out of all the shot types.</p>
						</div>
					<h3 class="clear">Cannon Sizes</h3>
						<p><dfn>Cannon sizes</dfn> were based not on the size of the cannon itself but the weight of the cannonball it shot. these sizes were different for each nation but 
						there were a general standard used by the british which we will be focusing on. Like cannon and shot types the amount of different cannon sizes 
						quite dwarfs them both.</p>
						<ul>
							<li>1/2lb</li>
							<li>2lb</li>
							<li>6lb</li>
							<li>9lb</li>
							<li>12lb</li>
							<li>18lb</li>
							<li>24lb</li>
							<li>32lb</li>
							<li>36lb</li>
							<li>42lb</li>
							<li>68lb</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The amount of different cannon size were quite staggering but all that it means is the general size and weight of the cannon ball they 
						could shoot. So at the very low end of the spectrum there were tiny 1/2 and 2lb swivel guns then giant 68lb carronades. For the most 
						part certain cannons sizes were only present on certain rates of ships which I will go over next.</p>
						<div class="three_column">
							<h4>6-9lb</h4>
								<p>The 6 and 9lb cannons were the smallest and therefore made the standard cannons for unrated and small 6<sup>th</sup> rate Frigates. Furthermore 
								the Long nines were quite popular for many crews because of their accuracy and penetration. Not to mention that light weight of the 
								cannon balls made reloading fairly easy when compared to the bigger cannons.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="three_column">
							<h4>12-24lb</h4>
								<p>The 12 and 18lb were the standard main cannons of the medium sized 5<sup>th</sup> rates while only the larger Frigates had 24lb cannons 
								like the <i>USS Constitution</i> which boasted an impressive 32 24lb long cannons and 20 32lb carronades. These 18 and 24lbs had the greatest 
								range out of all the cannons and were common in Ship of the Lines (<abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>) middle gundecks. Furthermore this 
								is where the carronade size started at, since any smaller and they would be practically useless.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="three_column">
							<h4>32-68lb</h4>
								<p>The 32 and 36lb were the common cannon for the main gundeck(bottom gundeck) for the 3<sup>rd</sup> rate. while the 42lb cannon were reserved 
								to only the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 1<sup>st</sup> Rate. Now you might ask what about the 68lb cannon? Well the 68lb sized cannon were only for the 
								carronades so they were placed on many <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>s top gundeck because of their lighter weight when compared to th long cannons.</p>
