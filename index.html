				<h2>Ship Types</h2>
					<p>There are many different types of ships and tactics used during the age of sail era. So
					I will be mainly covering the ships, tactics and terms used from the mid 18<sup>th</sup>
					to early 19<sup>th</sup> century. However, many of the tactics and terms used during this
					time period are still in use today.</p>
					<h3>Ship Rating System</h3>
						<p>The <dfn>Ship Rating System</dfn> is a system at which the mighty British navy used to classify ships by the amount of cannons that are on
						the ship. Each nation had its own rating system but they were mostly all very similar to each other on how they ranked a 
						ship. For this website I will be using the british rating system. The Rating is as follows.</p>
						<dl>
							<dt>1<sup>st</sup> rate</dt>
								<dd>The 1<sup>st</sup> rate had 100 or more cannons. The first rate was the largest of all the ships with many having a total
								of 120 and more cannons on their broadside. One of the largest would be the <em>Santísima Trinidad</em> boasting an
								impressive 144 cannons.</dd>
							<dt>2<sup>nd</sup> rate</dt>
								<dd>The 2<sup>nd</sup> rate had between 80-98 cannons.</dd>
							<dt>3<sup>rd</sup> rate</dt>
								<dd>The 3<sup>rd</sup> rate had between 64-80 cannons.</dd>
							<dt>4<sup>th</sup> rate</dt>
								<dd>The 4<sup>th</sup> rate had between 50-60 cannons.</dd>
							<dt>5<sup>th</sup> rate</dt>
								<dd>The 5<sup>th</sup> rate had between 32-48 cannons.</dd>
							<dt>6<sup>th</sup> rate</dt>
								<dd>The 6<sup>th</sup> rate had between 20-30 cannons.</dd>
							<dt>Unrated</dt>
								<dd>Any warship with less than 20 cannons were deemed Unrated and were classified by their sails design but we wont
								be getting into that yet.</dd>
						</dl>
						<p>Furthermore warships could be placed in three different groups by the amount of guns and gundecks on them. The following sections will 
						tell more about each group of warship.</p>
						<div class="two_column">
							<h4>Ship of the Line</h4>
								<p>The <dfn>ship of the line</dfn> is a warship used to fight in a line formation in order to have more cannons able to fire at
								the enemy with being able to take lots of abuse from cannon fire. This in turn made them huge, slow and cumbersome with in some cases
								having a crew the size of a small town.Unlike the current battleships of today with turrets the ships of the past had stationary guns
								that were placed on the sides of the ship including the Bow and Stern(refer to the Ship Terms section at the bottom).</p>
								<p>For a ship to be called a Ship of the Line (<abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>) it needed enough guns to properly fight in a line
								(we will get more into that in ship roles and naval tactics). For the most part, if a ship had 50 or more cannons and three gundecks it
								would be considered a <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>. So if a ship is deemed a 4<sup>th</sup> to 1<sup>st</sup> rate, it is very likely considered
								a <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="two_column">
							<h4>Frigates</h4>
								<p>When you think of the age of sail era and pirate ships you are most likely thinking or visioning the Frigate. The <dfn>Frigate</dfn> is a very
								powerful ship, yet fast and nimble enough to not need any protection like the <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>s did. They mainly had two gundecks with
								between 20 and 50 cannons. They would be the 6<sup>th</sup> to 4<sup>th</sup> rate. However, many people call frigates that are
								4<sup>th</sup> rates a super frigate like the <em>USS Constitution</em>.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="two_column">
							<h4>Unrated</h4>
								<p><dfn>Unrated</dfn> ships were anything that had less than 20 guns. However there are many different types and styles of ships that made up the 
								Unrated section. Here is a few of the many types of ships used.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Sloop</li>
									<li>Sloop of War</li>
									<li>Brig</li>
									<li>Cutter</li>
									<li>Schooner</li>
									<li>Xebec</li>
								</ul>
						</div>
						<h3 class="clear">Famous Ships</h3>
							<h4><em>USS Constitution</em></h4>
								<p class="constitution"><img class="uss_constitution" src="images/uss_constitution.jpg" alt="USS Constitution's at rest by a dock." height="341" width="512">
								The <em>USS Constitution</em> is the oldest naval warship still in active service and able to sail by its own power. The uss constitution were
								one of six ships that congress approved in order to have ships to protect itself from the mightiest navy at the time, Great Britian, right
								before the war of 1812. The ship was soon nicknamed <em>Old Ironsides</em> because of the thick live oak boards that made it hard for small calibre 
								cannons to penetrate her side. She was a 44 gun frigate when it first launched but overtime it was refitted to have 52 cannons which makes her 
								a 4<sup>th</sup> rate in the British rating system. You are still able to see the ship in person and even walk on it, It is in drydock at the 
								USS Constitution museum in Boston Massachusetts.</p>

							<h4><em>HMS Victory</em></h4>
								<p class="victory"><img class="hms_victory" src="images/hms_victory.jpg" alt="HMS Victory's anchored off from shore." height="512" width="375">The <em>HMS Victory</em> is the most famous age of sail naval warship of the british empire. It also was the flagship
								(The main ship that the heighest ranked commander commands from) of Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson during the battle of Trafalgar in which the 
								british gave a fierce blow to both the Spanish and French empire by capturing and destroying the majority of their <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>s. Sadly 
								Nelson also lost his life during that battle. Like the <em>USS Constitution</em>, the <em>HMS Victory</em> is still around and you are able to see it 
								in Portsmouth, England.</p>
