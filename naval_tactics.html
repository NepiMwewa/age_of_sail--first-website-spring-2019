				<h2>Naval Tactics</h2>
					<h3>General Tactics</h3>
						<p>Unlike many think, the battles during the age of sail era were <em>won</em> by making the enemy unable to fight 
						by either <em>demasting</em> their ship or having the <em>crew surrender</em>. There were 
						a few reasons for this but for one, these ships were mainly made out of wood so actually sinking a warship made to float 
						was no easy task, wood floats after all. So instead making the crew surrender by either demasting or out maneuvering and 
						gunning the enemy was simply easier to achieve.</p>
						<p>However, there is another reason in which i talked about it briefly already in the ship roles page. 
						Capturing enemy ships was one of the most important thing for a captain to do. Of course surviving and 
						not getting captured was also very important. Capturing a ship would not only give a captain more favor 
						with the admirality but also bring him, his crew and his country wealth. It was not that rare for ships 
						to be captured renamed and refitted only for them to fight the enemy and be recaptured by the enemy.</p>
					<div class="two_column"><h3>Line Fighting Tactics</h3>
						<h4>Line importance</h4>
							<p> Like I said before.</p> 
							<blockquote cite="http://students.webdev.emrjackson.com/c111/harmon/ship_roles.html">
							<p>Line fighting were most importance aspect of any large naval battle. The coordination 
							of the Ship of the Lines (<abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>) were the largest factor in the success of a battle. The ships would 
							form a single file line in order to have more cannons able to be pointing at the enemy.</p>
							</blockquote>
							 <p>However, that is not the only reason. These large-scaled battles were massive in size and unlike the 
							 current day, they were not able to give instructions if the distance were to great. Along with 
							 low visibility with the amount of smoke created by the cannons made it impossible to accurately 
							 give commands from the commander to the ships in his fleet. Therefore with the admiral leading 
							 the line he would know that his orders could easily be transfered up and down the line.</p>
							 <p>There are more reasons but those are enough to get the importance of the line across.</p>
						<h4>Focus fire</h4>
							<p>I touched on it briefly in the previous statement but focusing fire is very important in any naval battle during the age of sail era.
							This would bring great devastation to the crew of the focused ship. Instead of 
							say 30-50 cannons shooting at a ship, it could easily have over 200 cannons shooting at it. This is one of the key ways 
							on how these massive <abbr title="Ship of the Line">SoL</abbr>s surrendered in the large scale battles.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="two_column"><h3>Dueling Tactics</h3>
						<p>The duel were quite important of the age of sail era as captains faught to preserve their honor and 
						raise up the ranks to command larger ships. It wasn't that uncommon for young captains to duel 6<sup>th</sup> 
						and even 5<sup>th</sup> rates captaining only a sloop or brig.</p>
						<h4>Raking</h4>
							<p><em>Raking</em> is one of the key points to winning a duel. This is deadly, not only to the key components like 
							disabling the cannons, but will kill and injure large portions of the crew. Just one broadside could easily kill and 
							injure half of the crew in the gundeck. You could see how crews could surrender with just one good rake.</p>
						<h4>Demasting</h4>
							<p>Like raking, <em>demasting</em> was the other key point of winning a duel. If you could make the enemy not able to manuever 
							or at the very least limit it. You could either get into a position to rake the enemy until they surrendered or have 
							a greater chance to out manuever the enemy to rake them.</p>
							<p>I went over the general tactics however there is a lot more that could be said on how a duel took place, the 
							positioning to demast a ship, along with even how they used the sails to turn using the wind and how the wind 
							affected the battles.</p> 
							<p>If you want to see some real time demasting and naval combat you can check out this video on youtube of 
							three frigates fighting three other frigates <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC37vP_Rp4Q"
							title ="youtube video of a Frigate battle (will open in new tab)." target="_blank">Frigate battle.</a>
							In this video you can see a lot of the tactics I talked about above with line fighting, focus fire, demasting and raking. Along with 
							some commentary of what is happening during the battle. Side note I am SeaWolf in this battle and this game is called "<a href="http://www.navalaction.com/#ageofsail"
